# What is Philoxenia ?

Philoxenia is a P2P space exchange platform targeted to people in need. Countries all around the globe
are experiencing the devastating effects of climate change, financial instability or war. An alarmingly increasing amount of
people are deprived of their homes. Philoxenia - from the Greek word "hospitality" - aims to provide the ability to those that are willing
to offer a place, for those in need, to do it in a transparent and incredibly simple way. On the other side, people requesting a space, can targeted do so.
